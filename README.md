Learning Journal is a web app that I created to demostrate how you can operate on stored data with [Django framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/). The technical purpose of this app is to show how to apply the four basic operations of persistent storage, create, read, update, and delete (CRUD).

From user's perspective, with Learning Journal you can keep a list of the topics you're learning about, and keep track of your progress. Whenever you learn something new about a topic, make an entry summarising what you've learned.
